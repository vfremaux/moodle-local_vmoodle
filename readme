Important requirements for VMoodling :

Summary of prerequisites
################################################################

0.1 Making the master patch for block subplugins handling
0.2 Making the master patch for block rpc function calls handling

1. Installing vmoodle block in codebase
2. Installing the master moodle as usual browsing to Administration -> notifications
3. Installing the config.php hook to vconfig.php
4. Configuring the VMoodle common parameters

Post install procedure
----------------------------------------------------------------
5. Having names resolved for all the virtual moodles, through an explicit DNS binding OR a wildcard dns binding
(local resolutions on the webserver could make it possible also).
6. Setting up the master Moodle with relevant startup settigns (including MNET activation).
7. Snapshoting the master Moodle as template for virtual moodling (may be long)
8. Deploying vmoodle instances (may be long).

0.1 Add possibility to blocks to handle subplugins and install them:
################################################################

The vmoodle block construction is using subplugins, that are plugins 
handled inside the vmoodle block scope. 

The generic block upgrade function of Moodle core DOES NOT KNOW about 
subplugins. For correct installation to be performed, lib/blocklib.php

core block management library has to be added the following patch adding
the appropriate hook at install and upgrade time : 

// PATCH : (Generic) Block subplugins detection and auto upgrade
if (method_exists($blockobj, 'update_subplugins')) {
    $blockobj->update_subplugins($continueto);
}
// /PATCH

Location is in function upgrade_blocks_plugins($continueto) at the quite end of the function : 

                error('Block '. $block->name .' tables could NOT be set up successfully!');
            }
        }

        $blocktitles[$block->name] = $blocktitle;
        
        <<<<<<< PATCH INSERTION POINT >>>>>>>>>
    }

    if(!empty($notices)) {
        upgrade_log_start();
        foreach($notices as $notice) {
            notify($notice);
        }
    }


0.2 Add possibility for blocks to handle xmlrpc the same way Moodle modules do :
################################################################################

This is an important patch needed for the VMoodle bloc to invoke XML-RPC functions
between Moodle instances. It fixes an inconsistancy of the MNET implementation was
lacking blocks to exchange information using network communications.

Patch point is : 

file : /mnet/xmlrpc/server.php
line : near 478
location : before (or after, no case, but an additional case) the handling of modules.

    // PATCH : Add RPC support to blocks 
    // STRICT BLOCKS/*
    } elseif ($callstack[0] == 'blocks') {
        list($base, $block, $filename, $functionname) = $callstack;
        $includefile = '/blocks/'.$block.'/rpclib.php';
        $response = mnet_server_invoke_method($includefile, $functionname, $method, $payload);
        $response = mnet_server_prepare_response($response);
        echo $response;
    // /PATCH
    // STRICT MOD/*
    } elseif ($callstack[0] == 'mod' || 'dangerous' == $CFG->mnet_dispatcher_mode) {
        list($base, $module, $filename, $functionname) = $callstack;


1. Master configuration changes : Installing the config.php hook to vconfig.php
###############################################################################

Main config.php file must be changed in order to plug virtualization hooking.

config must have an include call to vconfig.php virtualization configuration router.
You can obtain this file from the vconfig-dist.php template, making your own 
vconfig.php file in blocks/vmoodle and then install the hook point in the standard 
config.php of Moodle.

/// VMOODLE Hack
include $CFG->dirroot.'/blocks/vmoodle/vconfig.php';
/// /VMOODLE Hack

must be located BEFORE the call to lib/setup.php include and AFTER the static configuration. 

Setting up Apache configuration for virtual Moodling
####################################################

Moodle virtualization assumes correct routing of each instance to the same RootDirectory inthe server.

A way to do this is using VirtualDirectory. Here comes a sample of Apache configuration that allows
this kind of generic binding.

<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@mydomain.fr
    ServerName %mastermoodlehost%
    ServerAlias *.%mastermoodledomain%
    VirtualDocumentRoot "D:/wwwroot/%moodledir%"
    ErrorLog logs/vmoodle_common-error_log
    CustomLog logs/vmoodle_common-access_log common
</VirtualHost>

For example : 

the master moodle site could be : 

%mastermoodlehost% = moodle.mydomain.edu
%moodledomain% = mydomain.edu

Using a wildcard DNS
####################

Defining wildcard DNS record say, to resolve *.mydomain.edu
avoids having to bind each virtual moodle within the DNS server
before using it. 

Any undefined moodle will respond with an error message.

Cron handling by virtualization
###############################

VMoodle provides from now an automated handling of cron execution 
for virtualized hosts. It will be not any more needed to manually 
edit the cron tab for each new VMoodle instance. A single cron call 
to vcron.php in the VMoodle block implementation will schedule and 
rotate all VMoodle crons. The VMoodle cron should be run at sufficiant 
frequence so each VMoodle has the expected turnover.  

The ROUND_ROBIN mode runs a VMoodle per turn scannnig the VMoodle 
definitions in order.

The LOWEST_POSSIBLE_GAP mode guarantees a nominal period for each 
VMoodle by dispatching defined VMoodle on available cron ticks 
(still in table order).  

The VMoodle interface adds three additional attributes in the display 
for VMoodles : 

•amount of passed crons
•date of last cron
•time elapsed (in secs) since the last cron was run

On large implementations running heavy moodle cron jobs or a lot 
of VMoodles, it can be a good idea to make cron run on a spare little 
server that can run the codebase and has access to the database pool.
